Introduction

The objective of this project is to provide an android application exclusively for our college through which students can buy and sell old books, drafters, stationary, electronic goods and much more.

There are various applications of this project like
•	The students can easily find buyers for their books and other study related products.
•	Students will get books at less price and hence they will save a lot of money.
•	It will save time of students as they need not to go to market to buy things, as this app is for campus students, they can easily share things among them.

The future scope of this project is to make it accessible for multiple colleges in multi cities.


Motivation

In our college library there is huge shortage of books. There are only 50% student who get books from library and others have to buy, so they spent a lot of money on books every year and those books won’t be much use to them next year which made us think of making an application through which we can sell our old books and also we can buy old books from seniors at less cost which will result in lot of money saving.
